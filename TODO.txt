# TODO

- deck
    - distribute points to items per tier (currently all at max)
    - add baseEvasiveness to creature creation

- creature
    - change member variables from "modifier" to "scaler" or "offset"
    - add scaler on getters

- action
    - change Action to CombatAction
    - add NonCombatAction and have INNERPEACE in both
        - or have Action base class that has INNERPEACE in it's types
        - both inherit from base
    - add evade chance to every roll
        - based on target->get_evasiveness()
        - maybe change strike thresholds to subtract some fraction of evasiveness
    - remove scale/offsets if needed once implemented in creature
    - add players for catch chance, etc
        - maybe subclass it
    - implement catch, escape, rest of items
    - trim action deltas when applied
